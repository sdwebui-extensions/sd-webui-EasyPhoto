# EasyPhoto Developer Covenant
Disclaimer: This covenant serves as a set of recommended guidelines.

## Overview:
EasyPhoto is an open-source software built on the SDWebUI plugin ecosystem, focusing on leveraging AIGC technology to create true-to-life, aesthetic, and beautiful AI portraits ("true/like/beautiful"). We are committed to expanding the application scope of this technology, lowering the entry barrier, and facilitating use for a wide audience.

## Covenant Purpose:
Although technology is inherently neutral in value, considering that EasyPhoto already has the capability to produce highly realistic images, particularly facial images, we strongly suggest that everyone involved in development and usage adhere to the following guidelines.

## Behavioral Guidelines:
- Comply with laws and regulations of relevant jurisdictions: It is prohibited to use this technology for any unlawful, criminal, or activities against public morals and decency.
- Content Restrictions: It is prohibited to produce or disseminate any images that may involve political figures, pornography, violence, or other activities contrary to regional regulations.

## Ongoing Updates:
This covenant will be updated periodically to adapt to technological and social advancements. We encourage community members to follow these guidelines in daily interactions and usage. Non-compliance will result in appropriate community management actions.

Thank you for your cooperation and support. Together, let's ensure that EasyPhoto remains a responsible and sustainably-developed open-source software.
